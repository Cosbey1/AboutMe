        <p> Baseball is one of my favorite sports to watch. My favorite team is the Houston Astros. I have been a fan since i was a kid. A goal that I have is to attend a baseball game in every baseball stadium. So far I have knocked out the Astros, Rangers, and Braves stadiums.</p>

        <p> I have been doing Photography as a hobby for 7 years. My interest for photography began at 15 years old when a good friend of mine showed me some his photos. I began taking photos of my firends on an iphone but my passion for it didnt begin until i was 18 when i got my first camera. </p>

        <h2>Foods</h2>
        <p>As i have gotten older, i have become more of what they call a "foodie". i have grown out of my "chicken tenders and french fries" phase and have spent the past few years trying different foods. I have tried everything from Ethiopian to Asian foods. But my favorite foods consist of...</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Pizza</li>

            <li>Hot Wings</li>
                <p>Hot Wings are my favorite go to when it comes to food. i Can NEVER get enough of them. i Like all types of wings except the ones that are sweet in taste.</p>
            <li>Spaghetti</li>
                <p> I Like most pastas in genreal (excluding lasagna), but spaghetti is my all time favorite!</p>
